[ 12 5) ] A uniform steel rod whose ends are fixed, is subject to a tensile stress GREg/3) of 3.6×10" Nim" at 20 ℃. (a) What is the stress on the rod if the temperature falls to 10 "C. (b) Find the temperature when the stress on the rod disappears. (For steel the coefficient of linear expansion is 12x10"" K"!, and Young's modulus ix 2×107| NA=7.) (6, 6 4)) 2. [ 10. 9) ] Two rods of copper and aluminum, each of length 20 cm and cross-sectional aren 5 cm", are placed in contact end to end. The other end of the copper rod is at 90 ℃ and that of the aluminum is at 10 "C . The sides of the rods are insulated. (a) What is the temperature at the junction? (b) What is the rate of heat conduction through the rods? (Thermal condactivities of copper and aluminum are 400 W/m-K, and 240 Wim-K, respectively.) ( 5, 5.52) 3. [10 5) ] Two moles of in ideal monatomic gas is best from 300 K to 400 K at constant pressure, Find; (a) the change in internal energy, (h) the heat absorbed, and (e) the change in entropy: (3, 3,4 5)) #: [ 124} ] A heat engine operates between two reservoirs at temperatures 600 K and 300 K. In one cycle it absorbs 1200 J of heat and discharges 900 J of beat. Find (a) the efficiency of the engine, and (b) the change in entropy of each of the two reservoirs and of the universe in one cycle. (c) A Carnot engine operates between the same reservoirs and absorbs the same quantity of beat. How much heat is discharged in one cycle? (4, 4, 4 52)
